     <center> <img id="math" src="math.jpg"/> </center> <p id="thesci"> <em> Math </em> - Math is the science of numbers. A person who studies math is a mathematcian. Math is a extremely useful tool that can applied to the other sciences. 
     In the handbook you will learn about addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, and decimals. </p>
     <br> <br>
     <center> <img id="physics" src="physics.jpg"/> </center> <p id="thesci"> <em> Physics</em> - Physics is the science of the interactions between matter and energy (an explanation of matter and energy will be given in the handbook). A person who studies physics is a physicist. In the handbook, you will 
     learn about motion, forces, energy, light, electrticity, and sound. </p>
     <br> <br>
    <center> <img id="chem" src= "chem.jpg"/> </center>  <p id="thesci"> <em> Chemistry</em> - Chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, and changes of matter. A person who studies chemistry is a chemist. In the handbook, you will 
    learn about the differences bewteen chemical and physical changes, states of matter, the periodic table, bonding, and pH. Along with these lessons there will be tons of opportunities to do chemistry yourself. </p>
     <br> <br>
    <center> <img id="eng" src="engineer.jpg"/></center>  <p id="thesci"><em> Engineering </em> - Engineering uses the principles of math and physics to create and invent. A person who studies engineering is an engineer. You will create and invent with the activities in the handbook by building
    structures like bridges and buildings. You also will learn about simple machines. </p>
    <br> <br> 
     <center> <img id="astro" src="astro.jpg"/> </center>  <p id="thesci"> <em> Astronomy </em> - Astronomy is the study of space and the objects in it. The handbook will discuss our the planets in the solar system, the sun, the moon, the stars,
     and galaxies. The handbook will also help you explore the tools used to observe space like satellites and rockets.
