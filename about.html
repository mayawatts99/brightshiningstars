<center> <p id="about"> Women are absolutely amazing! They are our mothers, sisters, friends, and you! But sadly, women are rarely seen in physical science even though they are half of America's population. 
Women who are underrepresented minorities (black, hispanic, and native americans) are even less common in these fields. Women are some of the smartest people in the world and are completely capable of making new discoveries and being leaders in their field.  
Bright Shining Stars is an effort to get young ladies, like yourself, more involved in science. There are lots of fun lessons, hands on activities, and experiments for you to do in the Bright Shining Stars <a href= "handbook.html"> handbook </a>.  Be sure to get your parents' permission or help before
you download it! I know that you can be an awesome engineer, chemist, physicist, astronomer or mathematician!
<br> <br> 
If you dont know what an engineer, chemist, physicist, astronomer or mathematician is, fear not! We have explainations of each <a href="thesciences.html"> here!</a> And if you are not a girl in 3rd-5th grade, share our handbook with
someone who is.
<br> <br>
Have fun exploring!
